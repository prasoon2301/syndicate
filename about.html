      <h3>Customers can search for the nearest
  available vehicles. To make the search easier they can use various filters as
  price, type of vehicle required, etc. Renters will have to first get approval by
  submitting documents related to the vehicle and personal information about the
  owner and then upload the vehicle to rent. Customers will have to select a
  particular vehicle and book it online. They can also contact the owner of the
  vehicle</h3>
